1) var, let, const
- var is function scoped and can be redeclared; let is block scoped and can be updated; const is block scoped and cannot be reassigned.

2) map(), forEach(), filter()
- map() returns a new array by transforming each item, forEach() just loops without returning, and filter() returns a new array with items that pass a condition.

3) Arrow Functions
- Arrow functions are a shorter syntax for writing functions and donâ€™t bind their own this.

4) Destructuring Assignment
- Destructuring lets you unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables in one line.

5) Template Literals vs String Concatenation
- Template literals use backticks and ${} for embedding expressions, making multi-line and dynamic strings cleaner than using +.
